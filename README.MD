I wanted to try hackintoshing, so I did.
My conclusion is that I don't like MacOS and will not use it.

Interestingly, this EFI folder only works with 1vyrain custom BIOS and not coreboot with Tianocore as its payload.
Thanks to [5T33Z0 for their repo](https://github.com/5T33Z0/Lenovo-T530-Hackintosh-OpenCore)!
I had to change some stuff to make it work with my T530 like changing out the Broadcom WiFi kexts for Intel ones.
